I don't really intend for this repo to be consumed as a generic, re-usable
configuration. It's strictly intended to meet my personal needs.

Installs and configures various things with:

* Apache
* PHP
* ownCloud
* OpenVPN
* Dovecot/Postfix/procmail
* ntpd

If I'm really in an Ansible mood, I could generate a temporary
Linode API key and use Ansible to create my Atlanta-based Linode
using the standalone playbook in the directory root.
