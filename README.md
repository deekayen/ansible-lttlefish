# lttle-ansible-bootstrap

![Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)

I don't really intend for this repo to be consumed as a generic, re-usable
configuration. It's strictly intended to meet my personal needs.

Installs and configures various things with:

* Apache
* PHP
* ownCloud
* OpenVPN
* Dovecot/Postfix/procmail
* ntpd

If I'm really in an Ansible mood, I could generate a temporary
Linode API key and use Ansible to create my Atlanta-based Linode
using the standalone playbook in the directory root.

To keep the playbook idempotent and secure, the first time it runs, it
will create random passwords for the MariaDB root user, NextCloud, and
mail user. The passwords to those accounts will be saved on the remote
server in appropriate configuration files instead of in the global_vars
of this Ansible playbook like most other templates you'll find on
Github. Though these files are uploaded in-whole on the first run as
templates, they won't upload again after that because the remote server
is treated as the master copy of the passwords on these files:

* `/root/.my.cnf`
* `/var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php`
* `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext`
* `/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-maps.cf`
* `/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-mailbox-domains.cf`
* `/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-mailbox-maps.cf`

## System setup

This setup filled the `/usr/local`.
```
lttlefish# df -h
Filesystem     Size    Used   Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/wd0a      989M   75.4M    865M     8%    /
/dev/wd0h      482M   20.0K    458M     0%    /home
/dev/wd0d      989M    6.0K    940M     0%    /tmp

/dev/wd0f      1.9G   1019M    867M    54%    /usr/local
/dev/wd0g      989M    2.0K    940M     0%    /usr/src
/dev/wd0i     13.3G   60.9M   12.5G     0%    /var
```

This is setup for a 2G shared linode.

```

## Bootstrapping from scratch

* Install everything for OS, minus games, xserv, and xshare. xbase and xfont are needed for gd and imagemagik.
* Add authorized_keys to ~/.ssh/
* Install python3 so Ansible has an interpreter
  * `pkg_add python3`
  * `pkg_add py3-pip`
* Create a cert
  * `pkg_add certbot`
  * `certbot certonly`
